# My Magento 2 Learning Journey

This repository is my personal development sandbox for learning Magento 2. The primary purpose of this project is to gain a practical, hands-on understanding of the Magento 2 architecture, its conventions, and common development patterns.

Each module and customization within this project represents a specific learning task designed to explore a different facet of the Magento platform.
